Breast Cancer Tumor Classification
Overview
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors based on receptor status using machine learning. The best-performing model is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Data
Gene Expression Values: 5,000 features from DNA microarray chips.
Clinical Variables: Tumor size, lymph node involvement, cancer grade, etc.
Output Class: Categorical labels (ER+/HER2-, ER-/HER2-, HER2+).
Methodology
Preprocessing: Normalization, encoding, and feature selection (PCA, Random Forest).
Models Explored: Random Forest, SVM, CNN, and MLP.
Best Model: MLP achieved the highest Balanced Classification Rate (BCR).
Key Takeaways
MLP effectively captured complex patterns in high-dimensional biomedical data.
Feature selection was crucial for improving model performance.
The competition provided hands-on experience in predictive modeling for healthcare.
